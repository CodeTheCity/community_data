# community_data
This repo consists of a single CSV file. 

The purpose of this repo is to provide a list of community-curated open data sets. Many, if not all of these, consist of data to be found in [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org). 

In that case the link in the CSV file will point to a query which may be run in [Wikidata Query Service](https://query.wikidata.org) after which the results may be downloaded as CSV, TSV, Json etc.  

A supplementary link to a SPARQL Endpoint for the query may also be provided. 

The CSV file will be used to feed non-official open data to [Open Data Scotland](http://opendata.scot).
